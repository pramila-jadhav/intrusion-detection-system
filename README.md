# Intrusion Detection System

This is an intrusion detection system project that utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify and classify malicious network traffic. The system is designed to be deployed in a network environment to monitor network activity and detect any suspicious patterns or anomalies.

The system leverages various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to accurately classify network traffic as benign or malicious. These algorithms are trained on a labeled dataset of network traffic, which includes both normal and attack traffic.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the system:

* Python 3.8
* NumPy 1.20.0
* Pandas 1.3.0
* Scikit-learn 0.24.0
